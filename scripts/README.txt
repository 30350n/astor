Unpack the contents of this archive into your main astor directory.
All scripts are meant to be executed on gruenau5 or similar.
All scripts need to be marked executable with "chmod +x <scipt>" or similar.

Compiling astor:
	compile.sh
	
Compiling examples/sleep:
	compile-sleep.sh
	
Running astor on examples/sleep with our extension point:
	run.sh
	
To generate graphs with plot_recordings.py twp files need to be replaced, with the ones in the "recording" directory:
	- src/main/java/fr/inria/astor/approaches/extensions/processbasedsorted/ProcessValidatorSorted.java
	- src/main/java/fr/inria/astor/core/validation/processbased/ProcessValidator.java
	
After recompiling recordings can be generated by executing:
	record-sorted.sh
	record-original.sh
	
Make sure to copy the generated "recording.txt" between calls:
	cp recording.txt recording1.txt
	
Finally graphs can be generated using:
	python3 plot_recordings.py recording.txt
	
Take a look at:
	python3 plot_recordings.py --help

to get more information about optional options.
